            So, This is all you will need, plus about a dozen onions, tennis
            ball size roughly chopped, and a tin of chopped tomatoes plus some
            spices. - The mix powder mentioned is just your own curry powder
            and can be made up of almost any spices that you favour. I would
            suggest use 4 heaped teaspoons of a mild curry powder, 3 of paprika
            (not smoked). 3 of turmeric, 3 of coriander powder, 2 of cumin
            powder and one of garam massala. Shake them all together with a lid
            on then pop them into a clean dry jar with a lid. There you have
            your own 'mix powder'<br>
            <br>
            The white vegetable shown is a bit of mooli, which you can buy in
            any Asian shop and even find in supermarkets now. (It's a mild
            vegetable a bit like radish)

    </center><font size="3" face="Arial">To start with, find a small glass bowl
    and add in a teaspoon of your spice mix powder, 1 of coriander, 1 of cumin,
    1 of turmeric and maybe a little cinnamon and garam massala. Stir in enough
    sunflower oil to make a paste and leave to one side. Then top and tail and
    peel about a dozen tennis ball sized onions,and roughly chop them.<br>
    <br>
    You will need of course a huge saucepan. I use my old pressure cooker
    saucepan which is just about big enough. Add about 350ml sunflower oil and
    heat, then add a tablespoon of garlic and ginger paste plus a squirt of
    tomato paste, stir briefly, when colour changes take off the heat and add a
    litre of water. Back on the heat and when up to a simmer, add the onions
    plus a teaspoon of salt. Stir to coat the onions with the oil/water<br>
    <br>
    Then off to peel &amp; chop the potato (1), carrot (1), green pepper and
    bit of cabbage (just a small amount) plus a piece of mooli.<br>
    <br>
    Stir the onions again and add enough water to just cover. Add half a
    teaspoon chilli powder, and a teaspoon of turmeric. Stir some more and add
    the chopped veggies. Stir once more. Pop the lid on and notice the time.
    Boil gently for an hour. Allow to cool overnight if necessary, and then add
    a tin of chopped tomatoes before blending the mixture with a stick blender.
    Now add the spices mixed earlier and stir again. At this point, some like
    to add say half a can of evaporated milk, or some coconut, either from a
    block or powder form (not desicated!).It's all a matter of what turns you
    on! Back on the heat and simmer for another 30 minutes or so, adding more
    water if the consistency is too thick. Set aside the quantity you want to
    freeze. When you come to use the frozen portions you should defrost and add
    some water and bring up to a simmer before using. The gravy should be quite
    'wet' almost like milk as the cooking in the pan later evaporates the water
    leaving the consistency you are looking for at that time. Usually the oil
    begins to show towards the end of cooking, then you know you are there!<br>

    </center><font size="3" face="Arial">For what it is worth, when buying some
    rice at our local Asian store, the lovely wife of the owner told me after
    washing the rice in warm water using my hand, rinse with cold water several
    times, then soak the rice 30 minutes or so. Get a pan of water boiling, and
    add a little oil and some salt. Drain the washed rice in a sieve and add it
    to the boiling water for 6/7 minutes. Then tip it back into the sieve to
    drain. Pour a kettle of cold water over the sieve and after it has drained,
    empty it into an oven proof container. Cover tightly and keep in the oven
    till ready to serve. Fluffing it up after about 5 minutes and dotting some
    colouring on opposite sides of the rice for later fluffing up again.<br>

    vspace="5"> I sometimes use a small herb container thingy called a spice
    ball - and dangle that in the water from the outset, before adding my rice.
    In it I put about an inch of casia bark, a bay leaf (Asian) a couple of
    cloves, a couple of cardamom pods (slit) and maybe some black peppercorns.
    Also I add about half a teaspoon of yellow colouring powder to the water,
    or even a bit less just to take the whiteness off the rice.<br>
    <br>
    If the mood takes me, I might chuck in a lump of lemon rind, or some jeera
    seeds.<br>
    <br>
    After so many failures, my rice is now perfect every time. I took the lady
    a small bunch of flowers the next week and the owner said he was beginning
    to worry. I was the third man that week that had given his wife
    flowers!<br>
    <br>
    By the way - I always cook my rice first before starting on my curries, then microwave before serving.<br>
