    </center>Food for thought (2020) As I write this I think how things have
    changed over the years. A good example is my mum and dad's home which they
    bought in 1935 when I was one year old.... £125.00<br>
    <br>
    After the war in 1950 he sold it for £625.00 which gave him enough capital
    to pay the wages for the first weeks wages in his new business in Strood
    ... That property is now valued at around £500,000.00<br>

            <h2>
              In the beginning
            </h2>
          </center>I had just started infant school when war broke out. After
          about a year of not much happening the blitz started and we had daily
          bombing raids. We lived exactly 12 miles from Central London and had
          six-foot high concrete tank traps running through our front garden in
          case tanks attempted to invade London. When the air raid warning
          sounded the 'alert' we didn't run immediately for cover, but carried
          on what we were doing with an ear cocked for the sound of gunfire, or
          aircraft approaching. You could hear the anti aircraft guns firing
          and knew the location of the guns, and so could tell the progress of
          the air attack. We also recognised the distinctive sounds of the
          different aircraft and could know without looking whether it was one
          of theirs or one of ours. I still love the sound of a Spitfire.<br>
          <br>
          Sometimes the German bombers flew over in formations of anything up
          to a hundred, or more. A few of our fighters would tear into them,
          from underneath usually, to avoid shooting downwards I suppose. We
          would stand out in the garden and watch, usually standing by a wall
          or a tree, but not near glass or in the open. The bombers just seemed
          to fly on towards London while our planes shot at them. Sometimes
          they would have fighters escorting them and dogfights would start and
          it was all the more interesting for that!<br>
          <br>
          During the night when most attacks occurred, from West Wickham where
          we lived, you could hear the guns firing from Biggin Hill, Bromley
          and Hayes. We would look out of our back bedroom window from where we
          could see Crystal Palace and bits of London and watch the
          searchlights picking out the aircraft and getting two or more of the
          searchlights together on an aircraft. All the guns would do their
          best to shoot it down, but I don't think they had a lot of luck.

              <h2>
                This is how it was
              </h2>
            </center>When our local ones started up it was time to go
            downstairs and settle down between the piano and the centre wall of
            our house. Mum would play the piano, I would turn the music for
            her, and eventually we would get off to sleep again.<br>
            <br>
            If our Dad was home he would most likely go out on firewatching
            duty with who ever's turn it was to patrol the road. (Usually a
            blonde - Miss Davies). I can remember him calling up to our bedroom
            and telling us to go back to bed, and it was raining shrapnel. In
            the morning, on the way to school we all used to collect shrapnel,
            nose cones etc. and swap bits, some of which had quite artistic
            shapes. The nose cones made good paperweights! Or fireside
            ornaments.<br>
            <br>
            One morning we woke up, and a 500 lb bomb had dropped in Mr.
            Mc|Donald's garden four doors down the road. He was a keen gardener
            and believed in 'dig for victory'. Well our bath was full of his
            carrots and potatoes, not to mention glass stones and dirt and he
            didn't have a garden that year, and we had no ceiling in the
            bathroom, toilet or back bedroom.. My brother's pillow had a bit of
            bomb splinter clean through the place his head would have been if
            we hadn't have gone downstairs that night. So he was, as my father
            would have said.... "Better born lucky than rich!" If the warning
            sounded, and I was less than halfway to school I would return home,
            or if I was more than halfway I would carry on to school. However,
            the air raids didn't occur often during the day so it didn't apply
            very often. In fact I can only remember turning back once.

          </center>Here is a picture of the warts Auntie Bett in Skellow, later
          got rid of. They can clearly be seen on the back of my hand. My
          brother John and I are sitting on the front door step of 115,
          Pickhurst Rise. Valerie's Pram can be seen stuck in the hallway.<br>
          <br>
          The picture must have been taken in 1944, because Valerie wasn't born
          until 20th December 1943<br>
          <br>
          Soon after this photo was taken. I left from Hawes Down School at
          9.00 in the morning on July 8th, 1944 with three bus loads of
          children for an unkown destination. Miss Killick was the teacher that
          accompanied us I remember. The buses took us to King's Cross station,
          where a steamer took us to Doncaster. 10 months later, the war ended
          and my mum came up to take me home.

            and packed a pretty hefty punch!)<br>
            <br>
            When we got to Doncaster, a bus took us to the village hall in
            Skellow and we (The evacuees) sat on the floor waiting for the
            local Mums to pick which ones they could take and look after. I was
            chosen along with a chap called Ken Pugh, by my "Aunty Bett" Mrs
            Yapp from 60, Crossfields Lane, Skellow - Pictured here with her
            husband, Bill Yapp and their son Raymond and his son Kevin. This picture
