      Jazz: The Beginnings
    </h1><img width="360" height="500" src="hoojazz.jpg" align="left" hspace=
    "20" vspace="10"> Well, I suppose the beginning must have been going to
    Kennard&#39s in Croydon, before the war with my mother, and whilst she took
    afternoon tea I would go and stand at the foot of the stage and watch the
    three musicians playing for &#39tea&#39.<br>
    <br>
    I remember being fascinated by the sound and spectacle. About 1948, I would
    have been about 14, I joined the Sea Cadet Corps at T.S.Sikh, just along
    the Croydon Road, Penge S.E.20. There, I elected to play the bugle and duly
    practiced every Tuesday and Thursday and did the Church parades on Sunday
    mornings. Wonderful fun was had all round.<br>
    <br>
    In 1950 Dad got the job wholesaling newspapers at Strood, in Kent and we
    all had to move down to Gillingham. A splendid house at 7 Park Avenue, with
    tennis courts in the back garden and loads of apple trees etc., etc. I had
    another term at Beckenham and Penge County Grammar school for boys to
    complete my school certificate exams, which I scraped past with 5 passes
    and a credit in art. When I finally left school, I thought I might have the
    usual six week summer break, but Dad said &quotNo! - you start work on Monday.
    Your wages will be 25/=d. a week and you will pay your mother &pound1.00 a week
    for your keep"<br>
    <br>
    That first Monday, I was sick and had diarrhoea all day, and then all
    evening too. Well eventually I was carted into St. Barts and at 7.30 the
    next morning they removed my appendix. When I came round at about ten to
    ten, the radio was playing Sid Phillips &quotHors d&#39ouvres&quot which was the
    signature tune to &quotHousewives choice&quot, a popular program at the time. A
    friendly voice in the next bed asked how I was feeling etc., and introduced
    himself as Peter Griffin. He was a couple of years older than me, and said
    when I felt a bit better and got home, would I like to come and visit his
    youth club in Magpie Hall Road, at the back of the All Saints Church. That
    first visit, they had the usual table tennis table and snooker table (small
    size), but there was a guy called Dennis Mills, who had a drum kit, and
    Peter Griffin who played piano (His father was the leader of the Empire
    Theatre pit orchestra) Between them they had the &#39Brons&#39 small band
    orchestrations for &quotintermission riff&quot    - It sounded less than perfect! When
    the evening was over, my newly made friends said they were all going to the
    Paget in Gillingham on Saturday to see &#39FREDDY RANDALL&#39 and his band, would
    I like to go along with them. I imagined it would be a sort of a dance.<br>
    <br>
    I arrived early and paid my 3/6d. and 2d. to put my coat in the cloakroom.
    I bought a light ale for 10&frac12d. and sat and waited. The hall, which would
    have held 600 people was empty, and Reggie Keam, (I now know) with his trio
    was playing for dancing. After about half an hour of this, I was on the
    point of going home. No one had turned up and it was nearly eight. Then the
    main doors were flung open and masses of people trouped in carrying the
    instruments and sound gear for the band. Within minutes the stage was set.
    The band all in royal blue suits, and Freddy, with a coffee coloured
    gaberdine suit and largish dark brown suede &#39brothel creepers&#39 - Without
    any further ado they launched off with &#39Jazz Club Stomp&#39 I was gobsmacked
    as they say nowadays. ... completely bowled over! The joint was jumping as
    they say. It was very soon jam packed full, and it was a standing room only
    concert. That&#39s the only way to describe it. People called for &#39requests&#39
    and the band duly played them. Never any reference to sheet music. when it
    finished at 11.45 there were special late buses to every point of the
    Medway towns and for the exorbitant price of 6d. (2&frac12p.) I arrived back in
    Strood, still floating on air to be met by my father. Where have you been?
    what have you been doing, who with... etc., The very next day I hunted
    through &#39Melody Maker&#39 and sent away to Boosey and Hawkes for a trumpet in
    a case with a &#39how to play trumpet&#39 book. It cost me &pound7.10. 0d. and in no
    time at all I had bought the sheet music to bewitched, bothered and
    bewildered, ... which I was! In order to short cut the process of remembering
    how the scale was produced, I just pencilled the fingering over the notes
    on the sheet music and something resembling it began to come out the other
    end. How ever, very soon I was caught with it and the usual inquisition
    followed. Who&#39s is it, where did you get the money, and worst of all &#39You
    cannot play it indoors it will annoy the neighbours! So I had to wait until
    I was alone to practice playing it.<br>
    <br>
    One evening I was walking from Montfort Road Strood to Gillingham where I
    lived, and from a small building at the rear of the &#39Bull&#39s Head' I heard
    the unmistakable sound of Tbn Tpt and Clt. I stopped. I stood and listened.
    When the tune stopped, I knocked n the door. ... Deathly silence! I knocked
    again....&quotwhat do you want?&quot asked one, Martin Cameron I believe. &quotMay I
    come in?&quot said I, and in I went. Can you play anything? I was asked. I have
    a trumpet I said, and the response was encouraging. &quotThat&#39s good&quot they said
    &quotMartin&#39s leaving soon, can you join us next week?&quot<br>
    <br>
    About that same time, I found that some other lads were gathering at the
    rear of Banister&#39s Motorcycle shop, in Railway Street, Chatham every Sunday
    morning. There were old disused and damp air raid shelters which were ideal
    for giving the effect of echo, and we were out of everyones way. No-one
    disturbed us. One Sunday morning there were a few of us running over
    &quotFrankie and Johnny&quot or something similar, when two youngsters arrived with
    banjo cases. Turned out their dad had made them the banjos. The younger one
    was still in short trousers. That was Tony and Vic Pitt .... and they could
    play!
